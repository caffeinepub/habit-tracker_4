Since placeholder habits will be seeded by the backend on fresh deployments, the empty state should rarely appear for new users. Verify that the component correctly handles the scenario where all habits are deleted, showing the empty state again. Ensure the empty state message is clear and actionable, guiding users to tap the '+' button to create their first habit."
