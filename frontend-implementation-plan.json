Ensure the background color uses a fully opaque value (e.g., change from bg-green-500/90 to bg-green-500, or adjust any opacity property to 1.0). Verify that the circle remains 44px in size, retains the check mark icon, and maintains visual consistency with the existing design while making the background completely opaque so no underlying content is visible through it."
