# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the transparency on the green check mark circles in the CheckInButton component so they are fully opaque.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove any transparency or opacity from the green check mark circle background in the CheckInButton component so underlying content is not visible through it.

**User-visible outcome:** The green check mark circles appear fully solid with no see-through effect, hiding any content or UI elements beneath them.
