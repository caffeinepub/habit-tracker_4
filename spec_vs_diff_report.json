  "summary": "The diff modifies HabitCard.tsx and updates frontend-file-summaries.txt and project_state.json. The file summaries explicitly describe that CheckInButton shows 'a solid green background' (fully opaque) and that HabitCard excludes the CheckInButton from reduced-opacity effects so 'the green circle remains fully opaque'. However, the actual CheckInButton.tsx component file is not modified in the diff — only HabitCard.tsx is changed. The fix appears to be implemented in HabitCard.tsx by excluding the CheckInButton from opacity reduction when checked in, rather than modifying CheckInButton.tsx directly. Based on the file summary evidence, REQ-1 appears to be addressed through HabitCard.tsx changes.",
