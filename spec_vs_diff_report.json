  "summary": "The diff addresses REQ-1 by fixing the habits data fetching in useQueries.ts. The useGetHabits query is now gated on the user being authenticated (via useInternetIdentity) in addition to the actor being ready, preventing unauthorized calls with the anonymous actor. HabitList.tsx is described as using useGetHabits and useEnsureDefaultHabits correctly. All acceptance criteria appear to be addressed.",

      "reason": "The build request only asked to fix habits not loading. The addition of automatic default habit seeding (useEnsureDefaultHabits) and its integration into HabitList with a 'Setting up your habits' spinner was not requested and introduces new behavior beyond fixing the loading bug.",
