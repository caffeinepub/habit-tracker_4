  "summary": "All three requirements are implemented in the diff. REQ-1 is addressed in backend/main.mo with a deleteHabit function. REQ-2 is addressed in HabitCard.tsx with native pointer/touch event handling for swipe-left gesture. REQ-3 is addressed in useQueries.ts with the useDeleteHabit mutation hook. One minor gap exists: the backend truncation prevents full verification of ok/err variant return type.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Returns an ok/err variant indicating success or failure.",
      "reason": "The backend/main.mo file is truncated and the deleteHabit function body is not visible in the diff. We cannot confirm it returns an ok/err variant. The frontend calls actor.deleteHabit(habitId) without variant unwrapping, suggesting it may return a simple value rather than an ok/err variant.",
